####Pre-requisites
Machines running CentOS 7.2, connected to network, with at least two
interfaces (3 if possible).

Before starting, please be sure to set http/https proxies if your network requires it.
*(Note that https_proxy should be set to point to a http:// URL (not https://).
This is an ansible requirement.)*

Pick a machine that is on the management network and has ansible installed
to run the following steps.

The setup scripts use python module *netaddr* and linux utility bzip2. If these are not
installed on the machine where you are executing these steps, you must install them
before proceeding. *(E.g. yum install bzip2; pip install netaddr)*

Note on *login_userid*: Ansible requires ssh to access the nodes in the cluster for
configuration. This requires a single userid that can log into each of the machines
AND has sudo permission.

###Step 1 Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/contiv/demo
```

###Step 2 Clone the contrib repo
```
cd demo/k8s;

git clone https://github.com/jojimt/contrib -b contiv
```


###Step 3 Fill in cluster info
edit cluster_defs.json

See cluster_defs.json.README for instructions

If you need ACI integration, edit *aci.yml*. See README.aci.md for more details.

###Step 4 Prepare machines

```
./prepare.sh <login_userid>
```
Supply login password when prompted.

###Step 5 Create cluster
```
contivVer is set by default to v0.1-05-19-2016.08-34-56.UTC.

set the contivVer if you want to use a specific contiv network version.
example:- export contivVer=$"v0.1-06-17-2016.08-42-14.UTC"

contiv network version can be obtained from: https://github.com/contiv/netplugin/releases

./setup_k8s_cluster.sh <login_userid>
```
Supply login password when prompted.

###Step 6 Verify cluster
```
./verify_cluster.sh <login_userid>
```
Supply login password when prompted.
